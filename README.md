PS 7: Blood Donation & Emergency Help {Mobile App}

A project by **Team Arceus** for AlphaByte2.0 , PCCOE
## 💡 Introduction 
**JeevanDhara** is a smart mobile platform that connects blood donors with recipients in real time. Using AI-driven donor matching, location-based tracking, and emergency SOS alerts, the app ensures that patients get the help they need faster than ever before.


**Problem Statement :** During medical emergencies, finding a compatible blood donor or receiving
immediate assistance can be a life-or-death situation. Many patients struggle to
access blood due to shortages, delays, or reliance on middlemen. This platform
aims to directly connect blood donors with recipients based on location, ensuring
timely donations and emergency support without unnecessary delays.

**Solution :** Our platform is a mobile application that facilitates real-time blood
donation matching and emergency assistance. By leveraging location-based
services, donor availability tracking, and real-time notifications, the system ensures
rapid response times, directly linking donors, recipients, and emergency
responders.
